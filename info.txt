If you want, next I can show how to convert that probability into a decision threshold system like professional pipelines use.

Next step after this would be:
Adding transit shape symmetry feature or moving to CNN-based classifier.




1) multiple tess sectors
2) transit symmetry
3) transit flatness
4) transit duration vs excepted duration
5) combine xgboost randomforest (take weighted avg)
6) add cross validation, calibration, probability calibration

7) Add shape features
8) Add odd-even test (stronger version)
9) Add TLS model fit metrics
10) Add statistical confidence (SDE threshold)
11) Add multi-sector check
12) No statistical false-alarm probability
13) No stellar parameter constraints
    Transit duration must match:
        Star radius
        Orbital period

14) Data scale + statistical rigor. (Priority)
15) use keppler 
16) cache only processed data not raw.   (Priority)
