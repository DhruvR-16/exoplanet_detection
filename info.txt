If you want, next I can show how to convert that probability into a decision threshold system like professional pipelines use.

Next step after this would be:
Adding transit shape symmetry feature or moving to CNN-based classifier.

if the prediciton is already made then get that from the csv instead of making a new one(saved time)

1) multiple tess sectors
2) transit symmetry
3) transit flatness
4) transit duration vs excepted duration
5) combine xgboost randomforest (take weighted avg)
6) 

1️⃣ Add shape features
2️⃣ Add odd-even test (stronger version)
3️⃣ Add TLS model fit metrics
4️⃣ Add statistical confidence (SDE threshold)
5️⃣ Add multi-sector check
